        <h3>Business Description</h3>
        <p>ICUPhones started out as an idea by a group of friends who initially were not enitrely serious about the whole idea. Gradually they expanded on ideas and business plans and invested time and money into the entire thing and over-time, their business grew at an alarming rate causing them to bring on-board a large team of staff and workers with expertise in all different areas such as technician, customer service, hardware technician and other jobs expected within a phone company. ICUPhones expanded their buildings, name and technology worldwide giving them recognition all over the world which eventually started raking in income and presented another challenge of shipping items across the globe. By the start of 2024, ICUPhones reached its 15th anniversary since being created and continutes to expand to this day as one of the highest ranking and most successful phone companies that there is today. Their rivals such as Apple and upcoming brand Oppo put them to the test at every new release. ICUPhones continues to expand. </p>
