        <h3><u>What Makes Us Better</u></h3>
        <p>Unlike all the big egotistical brands out there, we are humble and know what our company is instead of thinking that we are better than everyone else. Because of this, we deliver our employees a better and more comforting work environment with multiple different ranges of leisurely activities, items and services. We believe that everyone should be treated with respect in our workplace no matter their differences, ethnicity, height, position in the job and everything inbetween. This means that someone on the board of directors will be treated with as much respect as somebody who is a janitor. Due to this, our staff come to work in whatever means of travel knowing that they wont have the fear of being picked on, bullied, discriminated or left out here at ICUPhones due to the fact I stated previously about respect. We have an an increase annually of 2.7% to your current salary boosting your pay by simply working here at ICUPhones. Bonus percentage is awarded based off of cooperation, work and communication to others. Because of this, this strives our workers to hard-workers, willing to help and be supportive to everybody around them each hoping for that 2.7% annual raise.</p>

        <h3><u>Why Us</u></h3>
        <p>As stated in the 'What Makes Us Better' section on this page, each reason also contrasts the same effect onto this section of the page. Our key feature is the increase in pay from 2.7% for just being at work ranging to a staggering 8.6% per year if you stand out with your work, honesty, respect, communication and things such as that. Because of this, this causes our workers to strive to reach that top spot and gain the 8.6% increase causing a humorous, friendly and harmless competition inside of the workplace as everyone drains all their skills and expertise to excel above everyone else in ICUPhones. The pay increase is the same no matter what the position you are, giving everybody equal chances instead of getting a boost the higher you are. Our initial salary starts at £45,000/annum ranging all the way up to £330K at the role of Vice President. Our workers know of this which is what pushes them to constantly improve which is the reason that caused our rating to go from a measly 2.4 starts on <a href="https://uk.trustpilot.com/" class="trust">TrustPilot</a> to a whopping 4.8 with (3,181 reviews). Due to this blessing, alot of attention has been brought upon our business gaining attention from all around the world.</p>
